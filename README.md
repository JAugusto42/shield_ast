**Shield AST** is a powerful command-line tool for **Application Security Testing**, combining multiple open-source scanners into a single workflow. With `ast`, you can run **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing), **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis), and **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code) analysis quickly and automatically, helping you identify and fix vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Ruby** (version 3.0 or later) must be installed on your system.  
  You can check your Ruby version with:
```bash
ruby -v
```
If you don't have Ruby installed, follow the instructions at: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install the gem
gem install ast
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
ast [command] [options]
```

### Commands
- **`scan [path]`** – Scans a directory for vulnerabilities. Defaults to the current directory.
- **`report`** – Generates a detailed report from the last scan.
- **`help`** – Displays this help message.

### Options
- **`-s, --sast`** – Run SAST using [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev).
- **`-c, --sca`** – Run SCA using [OSV Scanner](https://osv.dev).
- **`-i, --iac`** – Run IaC analysis using [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) with infrastructure rules.
- **`-o, --output`** – Specify the output format (`json`, `sarif`, `console`).
- **`-h, --help`** – Show this help message.
- **`--version`** – Show the AST version.

## ✨ NEW: AI-Powered False Positive Analysis

Shield AST can use the **Google Gemini API** to automatically analyze findings and flag potential false positives, helping you focus on what matters most.

### How to Enable It

To activate this feature, you need a Google AI API key.

#### 1. Get Your API Key
1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
2.  Click on **"Create API key"**. You might need to log in with your Google account.
3.  Copy the generated API key. It's a long string of letters and numbers.

#### 2. Set the Environment Variable
Set the API key as an environment variable in your terminal.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

---

## 📌 Examples

```bash
# Scan the current directory for all types of vulnerabilities
ast scan

# Run only SAST and SCA on a specific project folder
ast scan /path/to/project --sast --sca

# Generate a report in SARIF format
ast report --output sarif
```

---

## 🛠 How It Works

AST integrates well-known open-source scanners into a single CLI tool:
- **SAST** – [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) for static code analysis
- **SCA** – [OSV Scanner](https://osv.dev) for dependency vulnerability scanning
- **IaC** – [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) rules for Infrastructure as Code

This unified approach streamlines security testing, enabling developers to catch security issues earlier in the development process.
